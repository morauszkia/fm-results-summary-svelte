## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS framework
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - Build Tool

### What I learned

After I finished this challenge using Vue.js (for the result see [this page](https://github.com/morauszkia/fm-results-summary-component) and [repo](https://morauszkia.github.io/fm-results-summary-component/)), I wanted to build it with Svelte, too. So, this is it. It was great to revisit Svelte after a long time. In the meantime Svelte evolved with adopting the runes, so there was some new stuff to learn. (There always is with web development, isn't there?) But I still like Svelte, like its simplicity and built in reactivity and basically everything. DX was really great. I hope to see Svelte gaining popularity in the future.

### Continued development

In the future I want to use Svelte more often to build more complex applications. Probably I won't revisit this challenge, but who knows.

### Useful resources

- [Svelte docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/overview)
- [Vite docs](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html) - These helped me a lot, especially with static asset handling and deployment.
